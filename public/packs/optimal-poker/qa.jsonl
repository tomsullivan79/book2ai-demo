{"id":"poker.qa0001","q":"Suppose both players play a strategy of always going to the comedy. Is this an equilibrium? How can you tell?","a":"Yes, this is an equilibrium. To test it, we check whether either player can unilaterally change his or her strategy to achieve a higher payoff. Blanca already has her highest possible payout with this set of strategies, so she's got no incentive to change.\n\nWhat about Andrew? He was more interested in the drama than the comedy, so let's see what happens if he changes his strategy and goes to see the drama. Then the players end up in in the lower left quadrant, where Andrew has a payoff of 1, which is lower than what it would be if he stuck with the comedy. Even though Andrew wanted to see the drama, what he wanted most of all was to go to the movies with Blanca, and that won't happen if he unilaterally changes his strategy.\n\nThe \"unilaterally\" qualifier is important here. Even though this set of strategies does not give Andrew his highest possible payoff, the only way he can achieve a better outcome is if both players change their strategies, so it is an equilibrium, and he has no incentive to deviate from it.\n","source_chunk":"poker.qa0001"}
{"id":"poker.qa0002","q":"What if Andrew's strategy is always to go to the drama and Blanca's is to always go to the comedy? Is this an equilibrium? How can you tell?","a":"This is not an equilibrium, because either player could achieve a better payoff by changing his or her strategy. If Andrew changes strategies and goes to the comedy, his payoff increases from 1 to 4. If Blanca changes strategies and goes to the drama, her payoff increases from 1 to 4. The only way they wouldn't achieve a better outcome would be if they both changed strategies, but that wouldn't be a unilateral change.\n","source_chunk":"poker.qa0002"}

{"id":"poker.qa0006","q":"Suppose that you make a $100 bluff into a $100 pot on the river. If we assume that your opponent will fold 40% of the time and that you will lose any time he does not fold, what is the EV of this bet?","a":"It's -$20, meaning you would lose an average of $20 each time you attempted this bluff.\n\nTo arrive at this answer, we can use the same equation as the example above. We just need to change the amount that you will lose if your opponent calls or raises from $50 to $100. That gives us EV = $100\\* %Fold - $100\\* %Call - $100\\* %Raise.\n\nOnce again, we can combine %Call and %Raise into 60%, since we don't care what your opponent does if he doesn't fold. So, EV = $100\\*.4 - $100 \\*.6 = -$20.\n\nIf your opponent will only fold 40% of the time, then you would lose an average of $20 every time you made this bet, even though you would sometimes get lucky and win the pot.\n","source_chunk":"poker.qa0006"}
{"id":"poker.qa0007","q":"Explain or demonstrate why none of the boxes in the grid above represents an equilibrium.","a":"If Christina goes to Room A and David goes to Room B, then David's payoff would be $0. This would not be an equilibrium, because David could unilaterally increase his payoff by going to Room A to collect his $100. But both players going to Room A is also not an equilibrium, as Christina could get a better payoff by changing her strategy and going to Room B so as not to pay the $100.\n\nAny pure strategy pair would result in the players always going to the same room or always going to a different room, and in each case there would be a player who could change his or her strategy to get a better payoff.\n\nUnlike in the other scenarios we've looked at, pure strategies will never produce an equilibrium for this game. The players need to mislead each other about their intentions, and that requires mixed strategies, some method of choosing a room that the opponent cannot predict.\n","source_chunk":"poker.qa0007"}
{"id":"poker.qa0008","q":"What is the equilibrium for this game?","a":"The equilibrium is for each player to choose randomly, whether by flipping a coin or some other method, with a 1/2 chance of going to Room A and a 1/2 chance of going to Room B.\n\nThe equilibrium requires mixed strategies because the available pure strategies are predictable. If Christina just picked a room and went there, she would be guessing about where David was likely to show up. If she guesses wrong - if David correctly predicts where she will be - she gets a bad outcome. Likewise if David tries to just pick a room.\n\nIn the scenarios we looked at previously, predictability was a good thing. When you're sharing a road with other drivers or going out with friends, you typically want them to know what your strategy is going to be, because it is possible to arrive at win-win solutions. Some out- comes are better for everyone involved and some are worse for everyone involved, and all players are incentivized to arrive at the former. The Dodging a Debt scenario, like most two-player poker situations, is a zero-sum game. A gain for one player is a loss for another, so an outcome that is good for one player is not good for the other. Christina is actively trying to avoid David, so she needs to be unpredictable. That's where a mixed strategy comes in handy.\n\nAs for why each player's strategy is to choose each room with 1/2 probability, this has to do with the player's payoffs. Christina's only interest is in dodging David; she doesn't otherwise care which room she goes to. Nor does David have any preference other than trying to catch up with Christina. By being unpredictable in exactly this way, each player creates a situation where there is no good strategy for his or her opponent. Whatever the opponent chooses, he or she will have only a 1⁄2 chance of choosing the right room. If David went to either room with greater than 1⁄2 frequency, this would be exploitable. That is, Christina could have a better than 1⁄2 chance of dodging him if she could predict what his preference would be.\n","source_chunk":"poker.qa0008"}
{"id":"poker.qa0009","q":"What is each player's EV at equilibrium?","a":"To find a player's EV, you must look at all possible outcomes of his action, how likely each is, and what each is worth to him.\n\nThis game has four possible outcomes: 1) Both players go to Room A, David gets $100; 2) Christina goes to A and David goes to B, David gets $0; 3) Both players go to B, David gets $100; 4) Christina goes to B and David goes to A, David gets $0.\n\nThe probability of each of these outcomes is the probability of Christina going to the given room multiplied by the probability of David going to the given room. In this example, those probabilities are all 50%, so the equation for David's EV is (.5 \\* .5 \\* $100) + (.5 \\* .5 \\* $0) + (.5 \\* .5 \\* $100) + (.5 \\* .5 \\* $0) = $50\n\nEssentially, David has a 50% chance of choosing the same room as Christina, whichever room that happens to be, and collecting his $100. That amounts to an EV of $50.\n\nBecause this is a zero-sum game, Christina's EV must be -$50. For David to make money, she must lose an equivalent amount. There is a 1/2 chance that she will have to pay her debt to David and a 1/2 chance that she dodges him.\n","source_chunk":"poker.qa0009"}
{"id":"poker.qa0010","q":"Prove that neither player has incentive to deviate from his or her equilibrium strategy.","a":"To prove an equilibrium, we can experiment with changing a single player's strategy and see whether any change that player makes could improve his payoff relative to the supposed equilibrium that we are testing. Let's try keeping Christina's strategy the same - she'll still go to each room with 1/2 probability - and changing David's.\n\nIf Christina flips a coin to decide which room to play at, while David plays a pure strategy of going to Room A, then the probabilities of each outcome change, and David's new equation looks like this: (.5 \\* 1 \\* $100) + (.5 \\* 1 \\* $0) + (.5 \\* 0 \\* $100) + (.5 \\* 0 \\* $0) = $50\n\nIn this case, David always goes to Room A, and there is a 50% chance that Christina also chooses Room A, in which case David gets his $100. His EV is still $50, so this change does not improve his payoff.\n\nWhat if David played a more complicated strategy, with an 80% chance of going to Room A and a 20% chance of going to Room B? Then the equation would look like this:\n\n(.5 \\*.8 \\* $100) + (.5 \\* .8 \\* $0) + (.5 \\* .2 \\* $100) + (.5 \\* .2 \\* $0) = $50\n\nDavid could change his strategy in lots of ways: he could play a pure strategy of going to Room B, he could flip a coin, or he could randomize in some other proportion. None of these improves his payoff, though. No matter what he does, he has a 1/2 chance of choosing the room where Christina will be.\n\nWe'd get the same result by keeping David's coin flipping strategy static and experimenting with different strategies for Christina. No matter what change she made, if David played his half of the equilibrium, she would have an EV of -$50.\n\nIt's important to note that even though the EVs remain the same when we change one player's strategy, there is no longer an equilibrium. If Christina flips a coin while David consistently goes to Room A, their EVs remain the same, but now David's strategy is exploitable. The risk he takes is that if Christina also changes her strategy, she might end up with a better than 1/2 chance of evading him. There are infinitely many strategy pairs that would yield EVs of (-$50, $50) in this game, but only one of them is an equilibrium.\n","source_chunk":"poker.qa0010"}
