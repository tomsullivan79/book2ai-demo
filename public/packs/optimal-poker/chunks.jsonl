We'll consider instead a few \"games\" so simple that, although you have played them may times, you probably never thought of as exercises in game theory. They are, though!\n\nBy investigating how equilibrium applies in these simple cases, we'll build your understanding of the concept in general, leaving you better equipped to make use of it in the more complicated scenarios that poker presents. We'll also talk a bit about other important game theoretic concepts such as strategy, and about how computers can assist us in solving the equilibria of more complex games.\n\nBy the end of this chapter, you should be able to:\n\n*   Define \"equilibrium\" and \"strategy\" as these terms are used in game theory.\n*   Understand what it means for two strategies to be in equilibrium.\n*   Recognize when a pair of strategies is not an equilibrium.\n*   Explain the difference between pure strategies and mixed strategies and know when each arises."}

Wikipedia defines it as \"a complete algorithm for playing the game, telling a player what to do for every possible situation throughout the game.\" For our purposes, a poker strategy will describe not just a vague description of style (\"tight and aggressive\", for instance) but rather exactly what you will do in every possible situation, with every hand you could possibly have in that situation."}
{"id":"poker.c0005","page":null,"type":"text","text":"For example, my pre-flop strategy for playing in first position at a nine-handed table might be to raise three times the big blind with a pair of 7s or better, AQo or better, and any suited broadway hand, to raise 20% of the time that I have suited connectors T9s through 76s, and to fold everything else. To really be complete, I'd also need to describe how I'd respond to three-bets of various sizes from each opponent. This is more information than most human brains can store and process at once, which is why computers are such valuable tools for studying game theory rigorously. When actually playing poker, we won't be able to formulate strategies with nearly the same precision, but we still must consider how we will handle future situations we could encounter, both before and after the flop, in order to make good deci- sions in the current situation.\n\nWe'll also need to have some idea about our opponent's likely strategy, or at least about what strategies will be available to him. Knowing that we'll be vulnerable to bluffs on certain rivers, for instance, might inform which hands we call with on the turn.\n\n###"}
{"id":"poker.c0006","page":null,"type":"text","text":"### NASH EQUILIBRIUM\n\nAn equilibrium, sometimes called a Nash Equilibrium after mathematician John Nash, is a set of strategies for all players in a game such that no player has incentive to deviate unilaterally from his strategy. For example, if you and I were playing equilibrium strategies in a heads up poker game, I could tell you exactly how I would play every hand in every possible situation, and you could give me the same information, and neither of us would want to change anything about our strategies even after we had perfect information about how the other would play. That formal definition makes it sound more complicated than it is, so let's look at a simple example.\n\nTwo cars approach each other on a road, traveling in opposite directions. Each driver can choose to stay to the right side of the road (from his own perspective), to stay to the left side of the road, or to proceed straight down the middle. Neither driver has a preference for which part of the street he drives on, but both would strongly prefer to avoid a collision."}
{"id":"poker.c0007","page":null,"type":"text","text":"This is not a game in the ordinary sense, but for our purposes it is. There are multiple players, each can choose from multiple moves, and the payoff for each player depends on both his own choice and that of the other player. In other words, without knowing what the other player will do, a player cannot predict what the result of his own choice will be. If he moves to the right, he might continue safely on his way, or he might get a collision - the result depends on what the other driver chooses.\n\nThe grid below represents the entire game. The options along the left side are the choices that the first driver can make, and the options along the top are the choices that the second driver can make. The box at the intersection of two options represents the payoffs for both players if they choose those options. The first number in each pair represents the payoff for the first driver, and the second number the payoff for the second driver. Successfully passing each other is scored as a 1, while a collision, which would be very bad news for both drivers, is scored as a -10."}

If both players consistently make the same choice, then that's an equilibrium. They both get what they want, which is to keep on driving without a collision, and neither has any incentive to do anything different."}
{"id":"poker.c0009","page":null,"type":"text","text":"There's no intrinsic reason why consistently staying to the right is any better or worse than consistently staying to the left, and indeed in the real world there are places where both equilibria prevail. In the United States, the convention is to drive on the right. In the UK and some of its former colonies, the convention is to drive on the left. It doesn't really matter which you choose, as long as everyone is on the same page about what to do when the situation arises.\n\nA rational player might choose to drive either to the right or to the left, but she would never drive straight down the middle. That can only lead to collision, which is not in either player's interest. Although it's technically a move in the game, there's no reason to ever use it. In the vocabulary of game theory, this is called a dominated strategy."}
{"id":"poker.c0010","page":null,"type":"text","text":"### PROVING AN EQUILIBRIUM\n\nThese two equilibria - both players stay to the right or both players stay to the left - are so clear and intuitive that you probably don't need me to prove them to you. It's good to know how to prove or disprove that a certain strategy pair is an equilibrium, though, because in the future it won't always be so obvious.\n\nRecall that the definition of equilibrium requires that neither player can unilaterally deviate from his strategy and achieve a better result. To prove that two strategies are at equilibrium, then, we must experiment with changing one player's strategy at a time to see whether that player can get a higher payoff. If both players change strategies at the same time, that could lead to a higher payoff, but it wouldn't prove any- thing about whether the original strategies were at equilibrium.\n\nLooking at the grid, we can see that it is not possible for any player to achieve a payoff higher than 1. Thus, any box where both players have a payoff of 1 is an equilibrium."}
{"id":"poker.c0011","page":null,"type":"text","text":"Now let's consider the case where Driver 1 stays to his right while Driver 2 stays to his left. This produces a payoff of -10 for both players. We know that a higher payoff is possible, but that by itself isn't enough to disprove equilibrium. We must demonstrate that one player can achieve a higher payoff solely by changing his own strategy. That is, we will keep the other player's strategy fixed and try to find a way for just one player to change his own strategy and achiever a higher payoff as a result.\n\nIn this case, either player can do so. Driver 1 could change his strategy and drive on the left. That would improve his payoff (and his opponent's, though that isn't important for this purpose) to 1. That right there is enough to prove that this is not an equilibrium, but of course Driver 2 could also unilaterally improve his payout by driving on the right. If both players changed their strategies, there would be a problem, but that's not the test of equilibrium."}

I'll explain each scenario to you, then ask you to answer some questions about it, based on what you've learned about the concept of equilibrium so far.\n\nTwo friends, Andrew and Blanca, want to go to a movie together. Andrew would prefer to see a drama, and Blanca would prefer to see a comedy, but the most important thing to both of them is that whatever they see, they see it together. That is, Andrew would rather see a com- edy with Blanca than a drama by himself, and vice versa.\n\nLike the previous example, this may not fit the colloquial idea of a “game”, but it has multiple players, each of whom can choose from two different moves (go to a comedy or go to a drama), and the payoff for each player depends what that the other chooses."}
{"id":"poker.c0013","page":null,"type":"text","text":"One small suspension of disbelief is required to make this example work: you must imagine that each player chooses which movie to see independently, without consulting the other. Andrew may know Blanca's strategy for choosing a movie, but he will not know her actual choice. That is, if Blanca's strategy were to flip a coin, you can assume Andrew knows she will flip a coin but not the result of the flip. (If it helps, you could imagine the two agreed to go to the movies without deciding exactly what to see, and that Andrew subsequently lost his phone, thereby preventing them from coordinating their choices.)"}
{"id":"poker.c0014","page":null,"type":"text","text":"We'll want to do some simple math with this scenario, so we need to put numeric values on our players' preferences. For Andrew, going to a drama with Blanca is the best-case scenario, so we'll make that worth five points. Going to a comedy with Blanca is nearly as good, call it four points. Going to a drama by himself is one point, and going to a comedy by himself is the worst outcome for him, so we'll call that zero points. For Blanca, it's the opposite: going to a comedy with Andrew is five points, and going to a drama with Andrew is four points. Going to a com- edy alone is one point, and going to a drama alone is zero points.\n\nNow we can represent the entire game, including both players' strategic options and their payoffs (see table “### Table: Andrew vs Blanca — Movie Choice (Payoff Matrix)”):"}

{"id":"poker.c0017","page":null,"type":"text","text":"### EQUITY AND EXPECTED VALUE\n\nPoker is full of uncertainty; you don't need a book to tell you that. We're going to talk about how to deal with that uncertainty, how to make good decisions despite it, and even how to quantify the value of the choices available to you when you cannot be sure about the results of those choices.\n\nMany poker players have unrealistic expectations of certainty. They do not want to bluff unless they are sure that their opponent will fold. They do not want to value bet the river unless they are sure that their hand is best. Some do not even want to get all-in with Kings before they see the flop to be sure it does not contain an Ace!\n\nProbably you recognize the fallacy of at least some of this logic already. Poker is not about certainty, it is about learning to make good decisions under conditions of uncertainty. The most successful players accept - embrace, even - the fact that they will frequently be unsure of whether a given decision will result in a win, or even that it will have a positive expectation."}
{"id":"poker.c0018","page":null,"type":"text","text":"Uncertainty in poker comes in many forms. Most fundamentally, before the river, you do not know which cards will come. Nor do you know the cards that your opponents hold. Even if you could determine an opponent's range - the set of all hands that he might hold given his actions so far - you wouldn't know which hand he actually holds. And even if you knew an opponent's exact hand, you still might not be able to pre- dict his future actions, such as whether he will call a large bet, or whether he will bet if you check.\n\nEquity and Expected Value are two different ways of quantifying uncertainty in poker, putting a price on a situation where we don't know which cards are going to come or what actions other players will take.\n\nWhen choosing between different options, it helps to put a dollar value on each to enable a direct comparison. However, when your payoff depends on the choices that another player makes, you can't know what your payoff will be. You may know the possibilities - going to a drama could yield a payoff of either 1 or 5 for Andrew, depending on what Blanca chooses - but that by itself is not enough to determine what it is worth to Andrew to choose the drama."}
{"id":"poker.c0019","page":null,"type":"text","text":"Equity and Expected Value can help us to work around this uncertainty and determine what a choice is worth to a player even when we don't have perfect information about future cards or actions.\n\nEquity Quantifies Uncertainty About Future Board Cards\n\nEquity, at least as the term is widely used in the poker world, is a measure of how much of the pot a given hand or range would win if there were no further betting.\n\nThe advantage of equity as a means of estimating value is that it can be calculated easily and precisely with the help of equity calculator software. An equity calculator takes two or more hands and/or ranges as inputs, generates 100,000 or more possible boards, and tracks how often each wins, loses, and ties. In less than a second, it returns the average win or loss per trial for each hand or range.\n\nFor example, an equity calculator can tell us that before the flop, AKo has about 30% equity versus KK. Versus a range of {AK,KK,AA}, it has about 37% equity. If you were to get all-in before the flop with AKo versus KK, you would win about 30% of the final pot, on average. If you were all-in against a range of {AK,KK,AA}, you'd average about 37% of the pot."}
{"id":"poker.c0020","page":null,"type":"text","text":"By measuring our hand's equity, we remove uncertainty about what the final board will be. Of course, we don't know whether our AKo will win or lose in any particular instance, but we can still put a price on what it is worth to get all-in against a particular hand or range.\n\nEven if you are not all-in, it can still be useful to know how much of the pot you could expect to win in the absence of additional betting. Because there will be additional betting, however, equity is only a very rough measure of what your hand will actually win. You may end up folding to a bluff, or successfully bluffing yourself, or paying off a value bet, or making a value bet. All of these possibilities and more will affect what it's actually worth to you to hold AKo versus KK in a given pre-flop situation.\n\nExpected Value Quantifies Uncertainty About Future Actions\n\nExpected Value, or EV, is a measure that attempts to take future actions by both you and your opponents into account. For this reason, though, it requires more estimation and is harder to calculate than equity."}
{"id":"poker.c0021","page":null,"type":"text","text":"For example, if I bluff $50 into a $100 pot on the river, I don't know whether you are going to call or fold. However, I can express the value of this bluff as a function of your raising, calling, and folding frequencies. When you fold, I win $100. When you call or raise, I lose $50. So, my EV is equal to ($100 \\* %Fold) - ($50\\* %Call) - ($50\\* %Raise).\n\nWith the help of this equation, if I can predict your folding frequency, then I can predict the EV of this bluff. If you were to fold 40% of the time, my EV would be ($100 \\* .4) - ($50 \\* .6) = $10. I collapsed the %Call and %Raise variables into a single 60%, because when you choose either of these, the result is the same: I lose $50. Even if I don't know how often you'll raise rather than call, it won't make a difference in this case.\n\nWith the help of a little algebra, an equation like this is also useful to get a sense of how often I need you to fold if I am to have an EV greater than $0 - to show a profit, in other words. We'll see how exactly that works in the next chapter."}

If she shifted that frequency even a little bit, going to Room A at a 51% frequency, for instance, then there would be a clear best strategy for David: he should always go to Room A, as he'd have the best chance of catching her there.\n\nBy getting that frequency exactly right, Christina creates a situation where David's choice is not meaningful.

{"id":"poker.c0029","page":null,"type":"text","text":"Real poker players have lots of weird preferences. They'll tell you that their main goal is to make money, but when you watch them play and hear them talk about their decision-making, they often reveal other preferences of which they may or may not be aware. Many are risk- averse, meaning they try to avoid big losses even if it means they will make a little less money overall. Some are risk-loving; they're there to gamble, and they're willing to play losing strategies because, like people chasing jackpots at slot machines, they enjoy trying to hit hands and win big pots. Some want to be regarded as good players by their peers and so will not pursue unconventional strategies even if they are likely to be profitable."}

This is not to say that other preferences are invalid, only that they are beyond the scope of this book. My goal here is to help you identify the most profitable choice at any decision point. How you weigh that against other considerations is entirely up to you. Regardless of your own preferences, you absolutely should consider your opponents' preferences. Identifying whether an opponent is risk- averse, interested in gambling, or obsessed with protecting her hand will help you determine how best to exploit that player.\n\nIn a game theoretic sense, though, a player would have no preference between two options only if they had the same EV for him. We will assume that when presented with a choice between two or more strategic options in a poker game, a player will choose the one with the highest EV. While it isn't always easy to determine which option has the highest EV, this is what most players are trying to do most of the time. For our purposes, indifference arises only when two or more options have the same EV."}
{"id":"poker.c0031","page":null,"type":"text","text":"Equilibrium strategies typically involve quite a bit of indifference. In fact, you can think of indifference as the goal of poker. You can't force your opponents to make mistakes - to call when they ought to fold, for instance, or to fold when they ought to raise. What you can do is put them in situations where there is no right play, or where the right play is difficult to identify because it is barely better than the wrong play. This not only denies them the opportunity to make good decisions but also increases the likelihood that they will make mistakes.\n\nThis may require some adjustment to how you currently think about poker. Most poker players are accustomed to thinking first about mistakes that they want or expect their opponents to make and then focusing on how to induce those mistakes. The game theoretic approach is to focus instead on putting opponents in difficult situations where they will have trouble identifying the correct play. The mistakes will follow."}

If you're playing online, you could flip a coin or roll a die or use a website such as Random.org to generate a random number.\n\nWhat you should not do is say, \"Well, I folded the last time this player bet the river, so I'll call this time. That way I'll be calling 1/2 the time.\" For one thing, the last time you folded was a different situation. The board was different, the action was different, and your hand was different. From an exploitative perspective, you might be able to guess whether the fact that you folded that previous hand would make your opponent more or less likely to bluff this time, but if you're aiming for randomness, then what happened in that other hand should have no bearing on how you play this one.

Hopefully, solving those has helped you better understand what equilibria are, why they are relevant, and how to find them. When it comes to solving actual poker situations, we need the assistance of computers and specialized software. These programs, called game theory solvers or equilibrium solvers or just solvers, enable us to approximate equilibrium solutions to these much more complex games. I say \"approximate\" because even when working with solvers, we're still forced to restrict the game space by limiting the number of avail- able bets. Even a computer can't handle the hundreds of different betting options available to you in a real game. After all, in a $1/$2 game with $200 effective stacks, you could bet $2 or $3 or $4 or any amount you wish up to $200. That's nearly two hundred strategic options! Then your opponent could respond to that bet with a raise of many different sizes, you'd have the choice to re-raise, etc. The number of pos- sible game situations explodes quickly."}

You could, for instance, allow bets of 50% of the pot on the flop, 50% or 100% on the turn, and 50%, 100%, or all-in on the river. Then, a solver could give you an equilibrium solution within these constraints. Restricting players to three bet sizes probably won't result in an output that's too far off from the true equilibrium, but strictly speaking, it isn't a solution to a no-limit game, it's a solution to a closely related game with limited betting options.\n\nSolvers have other limitations besides bet size restrictions. If you're solving for a situation on the flop, for instance, you'll still have to do some guesswork to input the ranges with which each player will see the flop. There actually are now consumer-facing solvers capable of solving pre-flop situations, but these are extremely computationally intensive, often requiring hundreds if not thousands of dollars in pro- cessing power to do substantive work."}
